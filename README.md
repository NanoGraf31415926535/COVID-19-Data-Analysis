# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data and provide predictions for future case numbers using traditional linear regression and advanced deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The project fetches real-time data, processes it, analyzes trends, visualizes results, and generates a report summarizing predictions.

## Features

- Fetch COVID-19 data from a public API.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to summarize key statistics.
- Predict future COVID-19 cases using both linear regression and LSTM.
- Visualize historical data and predictions.
- Generate a comprehensive report comparing prediction methods.

## Project Structure

```

│
├── data_fetch.py          # Fetches and preprocesses COVID-19 data
├── analysis.py            # Performs data analysis and trend calculations
├── visualize.py           # Visualizes data and predictions
├── predict.py             # Implements linear regression predictions
├── deep_learning.py       # Implements LSTM model for deep learning predictions
├── report.py              # Generates a summary report of predictions
└── main.py                # Main entry point for running the project
```

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

**Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will execute the entire workflow:
- Fetching the data
- Performing analysis
- Training prediction models
- Visualizing results
- Generating a report

## Data Source

The project fetches COVID-19 data from the [COVID Tracking Project API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api).

## Output

- **CSV Files**: 
  - `covid_data.csv`: Raw data fetched from the API.
  - `state_summary.csv`: Summary statistics for each state.
- **Plots**: Visual representations of historical and predicted case numbers.
- **Report**: A text file (`covid_analysis_report.txt`) summarizing the predictions and comparisons between models.
